Ever dreamed of having superhuman reaction times?

Want to dominate FPS games with godlike reflexes?

Well, this is the wrong place and year to be in (the year being 2025), This is a collection of Python scripts that beats the sh*t out of [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/).

## What Can This Thing Do?
It can beat the sh*t out of these so far:
- Reaction Time
- Sequence Memory
- Aim Trainer
- ~~Number Memory~~
- ~~Verbal Memory~~
- ~~Chimp Test~~
- ~~Visual Memory~~
- Typing Test

Technical features:
  - Low-level Windows API input simulation
  - Microsecond-precise timing
  - JavaScript injection for bypassing website restrictions

## How Do I Use This?
> Evan if you have somehow found this project, use it to your hearts content, i would be honored

1. Install Python (3.12+ recommended)
2. Install the requirements (that doesnt exist yet):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script you want (no full manuals yet):
```bash
python "path/to/the/script/code.py"
```

<sub>
i will add executable files later, for now im just working on making the "AI"
</sub>

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- Basic ability to read non-existent instructions

## Disclaimer
I made this for fun. Can't be f*cked updating it or anything, so don't expect anything.

## Contributing
LMAO

## Credits
- as said, Project inspired by [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/@codebullet)
  - Check out his amazing AI bullshit!
- Libraries and resources used:
  - **win32api/win32con**: Ultra-low latency Windows API interactions for mouse/keyboard control
  - **mss**: High-performance screen capture (~2-3ms latency)
  - **numpy**: Fast array operations for pixel analysis
  - **pyperclip/win32clipboard**: Clipboard manipulation for ultra-fast text input
