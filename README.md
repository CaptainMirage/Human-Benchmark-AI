><p align="center"><small>project inspired by code bullet</small></p>

Ever dreamed of having superhuman reaction times?

Want to dominate FPS games with godlike reflexes?

Well, this is the wrong place and year to be in (the year being 2025), This is a collection of Python scripts that beats the sh*t out of [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/).

## What Can This Thing Do?
It can beat the sh*t out of these so far:
- Reaction Time
- Sequence Memory
- ~~Aim Trainer~~
- ~~Number Memory~~
- ~~Verbal Memory~~
- ~~Chimp Test~~
- ~~Visual Memory~~
- Typing Test

## How Do I Use This?
> Evan if you have somehow found this project, use it to your hearts content, i would be honored

1. Install Python (3.12+ recommended)
2. Install the requirements (that doesnt exist yet):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script you want (no full manuals yet):
```bash
python "path/to/the/script/code.py"
```

<sub>
i will add executable files later, for now im just working on making the "AI"
</sub>

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- Basic ability to read non-existent instructions

## Disclaimer
I made this for fun. Can't be f*cked updating it or anything, so don't expect anything.

## Contributing
LMAO

## Credits
