Ever dreamed of having superhuman reaction times?

Want to dominate FPS games with godlike reflexes?

Well, this is the wrong place and year to be in (the year being 2025), This is a collection of Python scripts that beats the sh*t out of [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/).

## What Can This Thing Do?
It can beat the sh*t out of these so far (I know, very impressive):
- Reaction Time
- ~~Aim Trainer~~
- ~~Number Memory~~
- ~~Visual Memory~~
- ~~Typing~~
- ~~Sequence Memory~~

## How Do I Use This?
1. Install Python (3.12+ recommended)
2. Install the requirements (that doesnt exist yet):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script you want (no manuals yet):
```bash
python "path/to/the/script/code.py"
```
<sub>
i will add executable files later, for now im just working on making the "AI"
</sub>

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- Basic ability to read non-existent instructions

## Disclaimer
I made this for fun. Can't be f*cked updating it or anything, so don't expect anything.
